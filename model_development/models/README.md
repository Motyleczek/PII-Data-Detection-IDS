# Models

Here is the place to save all models that are either final or in development. I suggest that in naming them, remember to add either a version or a date of creation for ease of use. 

Mark your final models with the keyword FINAL at the end of the filename, ex. "supercool_LSTM_FINAL.h5"

Use this locally and commit only final versions of the models, as they can be EXTREMELY large. 

UPDATE: we will not be uploading them to github, but rather to a folder on google drive. It will be public and view only for others, however collaborators in this repo will be given editorial access. 

Link to the folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cTlw85rGdTf7dhR_Bs-PysGedhaod3Sb?usp=sharing

**Upload Instructions**
After uploading a model into the folder linked above, please update this readme file below with the filename, file description and any relevant informations about the model itself


Description of the models there:
1. `model_colab.zip` is the basic trained keras' deberta_v3_extra_small_en backbone's weights with a smaller net size than in the tutorial provided by the competiton organisers, this model weights can be used in the `model_development/chaos_sandbox/pii_data_detection_kerasnlp_starter_notebook_COLAB_VERSION.ipynb` notebook instead of running the training process
