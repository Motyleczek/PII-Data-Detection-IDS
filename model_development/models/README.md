# Models

Here is the place to save all models that are either final or in development. I suggest that in naming them, remember to add either a version or a date of creation for ease of use. 

Mark your final models with the keyword FINAL at the end of the filename, ex. "supercool_LSTM_FINAL.h5"

Use this locally and commit only final versions of the models, as they can be EXTREMELY large.
