        "The task of this competition falls under **Token Classification** (not Text Classification!), sometimes known as **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. This notebook guides you through performing this task from scratch for the competition. Implementing from scratch is a unique feature of this notebook, as most public notebooks use **HuggingFace** to handle modeling and data processing, which performs many tasks under the hood. One may have to look deeper into the repository to understand what is happening inside. In contrast, this notebook goes step by step, showing you exactly how Token Classification works. A cherry on top: this notebook leverages **Mixed Precision** and **Distributed (multi-GPU)** Training/Inference to turbocharge performance!\n",

        "Initially, raw text data is quite complex and challenging for modeling due to its high dimensionality. We simplify this complexity by converting text into words then more manageable set of tokens using `tokenizers`. For example, transforming the sentence `\"The quick brown fox\"` into tokens like `[\"the\", \"qu\", \"##ick\", \"br\", \"##own\", \"fox\"]` helps us break down the text effectively. Then, since models can't directly process strings, they are converted into integers, like `[10, 23, 40, 51, 90, 84]`. Additionally, many models require special tokens and additional tensors to understand input better. A `preprocessing` layer helps with this by adding these special tokens, which aid in separating input and identifying padding, among other tasks.\n",

        "One of the key factors that sets Token Classification apart from Text Classification is the data processing part. Unlike text classification, where we simply send our tokenized text to the model, in token classification, we have to apply more processing before sending it to the model. For example, when the `tokenizer` creates multiple tokens for single word or the `processing` layer adds special tokens `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, and `[PAD]`, they create a mismatch between the input and labels. Thus, a single word corresponding to a single label may now be split into two tokens. We need to realign the tokens labels with word labels by:\n",
